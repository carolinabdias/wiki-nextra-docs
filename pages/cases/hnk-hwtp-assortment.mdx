# Assortment 

## TL;DR



## Business context
The idea behind this project is to make the definition of the restricted sales plan more automatic. Some brands in Heineken were facing profitability issues, so the goal is to develop a model which could better allocate SKU’s volume within the CDAs in order to maximize the brand’s profitability. This would be done considering overall functional gross profit, as well as storage, sellout, and sales plan restrictions.

## Use-case
Make a recommendation of how much of each product should be sent to each CDA in order to achieve the highest possible FGP for a brand.

## Scope
The final recommendation is made for SKUs in all Heineken CDAs.
